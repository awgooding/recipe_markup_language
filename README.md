## Ingredients 
    - should be organized into either location in a kitchen or uniqueness or food category
    - should be able to be used as a shopping list
    - or should they be in the order of use? (No, use order doesn't matter if they're restated.)
- All recipes should be to serve 2 people, or, in cases where it's natural (as in a pie), in terms of one complete unit. The site could have a dropdown then to modify the number of people.
- should amounts be in one text style, times in another, and tools/ingredients in another?
- as something becomes something else, add adjectives to it. 
    - buy `mozzarella`
    - tear `mozzarella` into bite-sized pieces
    - add `bite-sized mozzarella pieces` to pizza
